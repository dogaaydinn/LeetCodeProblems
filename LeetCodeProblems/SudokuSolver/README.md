Sudoku Solver
=============

Problem Description
-------------------

The objective is to solve a given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle by filling in the empty cells.

-   Each empty cell is represented by the character `'.'`.
-   The solution must follow Sudoku rules:
    1.  Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
    2.  Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
    3.  Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

The puzzle is guaranteed to have only one solution.

Solution Explanation
--------------------

### Approach:

The solution uses **Backtracking** to explore potential numbers for each empty cell. The algorithm recursively tries all possible numbers (`1-9`) in each empty cell and checks if the current placement is valid. If a placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next number.

### Steps:

1.  **Iterate through the board**:
    -   Find the first empty cell (represented by `'.'`).
2.  **Try numbers `1-9`**:
    -   For each number, check if placing it in the current cell is valid using the helper function `IsValid`.
3.  **Recursive call**:
    -   Place the number in the cell and recursively call the `Solve` function to attempt solving the rest of the board.
4.  **Backtrack if necessary**:
    -   If the placement does not lead to a solution, reset the cell to `'.'` and try the next number.
5.  **Return true if solved**:
    -   If all cells are filled and valid, return true.

### Code:

```
public class Solution {
    public void SolveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Solve(board);
    }

    private bool Solve(char[][] board) {
        for (var row = 0; row < 9; row++) {
            for (var col = 0; col < 9; col++)
            {
                if (board[row][col] != '.') continue;
                for (var num = '1'; num <= '9'; num++)
                {
                    if (!IsValid(board, row, col, num)) continue;
                    board[row][col] = num;
                    if (Solve(board)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    board[row][col] = '.';
                }
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private bool IsValid(char[][] board, int row, int col, char num) {
        for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            if (board[row][i] == num || board[i][col] == num ||
                board[row / 3 * 3 + i / 3][col / 3 * 3 + i % 3] == num) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis
-------------------

**Time Complexity**:

-   Worst case: **O(9^(N))**, where `N` is the number of empty cells.
-   For each empty cell, there are up to 9 possible numbers to try.

**Space Complexity**:

-   **O(N)**: The recursion stack can grow up to the number of empty cells in the worst case.

Notes:
------

-   This solution is optimal for the fixed size of a Sudoku board.
-   Backtracking ensures that all possibilities are explored until the correct solution is found.
