## Zigzag Conversion
This repository provides a solution to the **_"Zigzag Conversion"_** problem. The implementation converts a given string into a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and reads it row by row.

### Problem Description
You are given a string s and an integer numRows. The task is to convert the string s into a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows and then read it row by row.

### Problem Statement
1. Difficulty: Medium
2. Topics: String Manipulation
3. Companies: Google, Microsoft


Example
**Input:** ```csharp s = "PAYPALISHIRING" numRows = 3 "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

**Explanation:** The zigzag pattern for s = "PAYPALISHIRING" with numRows = 3 is:

**P A H N A P L S I I G Y I R**

Reading line by line gives the string "**PAHNAPLSIIGYIR**".

Input: s = _"HELLO"_**** numRows =_2_****

**Output:**

**"HLOEL" Explanation:** The zigzag pattern for s = "HELLO" with numRows = 2 is:

H L O E L L Reading line by line gives the string "HLOEL".

**Constraints**
1 <= s.length <= 1000 1 <= numRows <= 1000

## Approach
Edge Case Handling: If numRows is less than or equal to 1, return the input string s as is.

**Initialize Rows:** Create an array of strings to store characters for each row.

**Zigzag Conversion:** Traverse the string s while alternating the direction of traversal between down and up, and append characters to the corresponding rows.

### Construct Result:###

**** Concatenate all rows to form the final result string.

## Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string s. Each character is processed exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string s. The space is used to store the rows and the result.

## Performance
**Runtime:** Efficient and suitable for handling input sizes within the constraints.

**Memory Usage:** Space-efficient as it only requires storage proportional to the length of the string.

## Why This Approach?
The approach efficiently constructs the zigzag pattern by alternating between rows and handles various edge cases such as very small or very large numbers of rows. Using a StringBuilder to concatenate rows ensures that the solution is both time and space-efficient.

## Key Points
Direction Handling: The solution correctly manages direction changes to simulate the zigzag pattern.

**Edge Cases:** Handles cases with fewer rows than the length of the string or when the number of rows is very large.

**Efficiency:** Optimizes both time and space complexity, making it suitable for a wide range of input sizes.
