## Merge Strings Alternately

This repository provides a solution to the "Merge Strings Alternately" problem using string manipulation. The implementation efficiently merges two input strings by alternating characters from each string.

### Problem Description

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Your task is to merge these strings by alternating characters from each string. If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters of the longer string to the result.

### Problem Statement

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topics:** String Manipulation  
**Companies:** Amazon, Microsoft  

### Example

**Input:**
csharp
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "pqr"

### Constraints
The lengths of word1 and word2 are between 0 and 100.
The characters in word1 and word2 are printable ASCII characters.

## Approach
Initialization: Determine the lengths of both strings and create a StringBuilder to build the result. This is efficient for appending characters.
Iterate through Strings: Traverse both strings up to the maximum length of the two. Append characters from each string alternatively to the StringBuilder.
Handle Remaining Characters: After traversing the shortest string, append any remaining characters from the longer string.
Construct Result: Convert the StringBuilder to a string and return it.

## Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2. We traverse both strings once.
  
**Space Complexity:** O(m + n). The space complexity is proportional to the length of the resulting string, which is the sum of lengths of word1 and word2.
  
## Performance
**Runtime:** Efficient and suitable for handling input sizes within the constraints.
  
**Memory Usage:** Minimal additional space is used, as the result is built incrementally.

## Why String Manipulation Approach?
Using a StringBuilder allows for efficient appending of characters, and handling strings with different lengths is straightforward. This approach ensures the result is built by alternating characters and efficiently handles edge cases like differing string lengths.

## Key Points
**Alternating Characters:** The solution effectively merges characters from both strings.
  
**Edge Cases:** Handles cases where one string is longer than the other or where one string is empty.
  
**Efficiency:** Utilizes StringBuilder for efficient str
