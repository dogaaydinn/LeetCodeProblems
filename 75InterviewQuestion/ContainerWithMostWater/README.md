## Approach:

The problem can be efficiently solved using the two-pointer technique.

### Initial Setup:

Place one pointer at the start (left = 0) and another pointer at the end (right = height.Length - 1) of the height
array.
Track the maximum area (maxArea = 0) as we iterate through the array.
Iterative Process:

In each iteration, calculate the current area formed by the two lines at the left and right pointers.

Update maxArea if the current area is larger.
Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, as this could potentially maximize the area in subsequent steps.

### Stopping Condition:

The loop stops when left meets right, as no further container can be formed beyond this point.
