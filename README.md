# LeetCode Solutions
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I am solving various LeetCode problems and sharing my solutions. As I continue to practice and improve my problem-solving skills, I will keep adding more solutions to this repository.

## Problems Solved
### 1.Two Sum
### 2.Add Two Numbers
### 3.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## How to Use
You can find the solutions in their respective directories. Each directory contains a README explaining the problem statement and my approach to solving it.
## Two Sum
- Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
- [Solution](https://github.com/dogaaydinn/LeetCodeProblems/blob/master/LeetCodeProblems/TwoSum/001-TwoSum.cs)
## Add Two Numbers
- Problem Statement: Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
- [Solution](https://github.com/dogaaydinn/LeetCodeProblems/blob/master/LeetCodeProblems/AddTwoNumbers/002-AddTwoNumbers.cs)
## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Problem Statement: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- [Solution](https://github.com/dogaaydinn/LeetCodeProblems/blob/master/LeetCodeProblems/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters/003-LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.cs)

## Future Plans
I plan to continue solving more LeetCode problems and will update this repository with new solutions. Stay tuned!
